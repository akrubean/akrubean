ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @akrubean - Passionate Junior Frontend Developer | Actively seeking Internship Opportunities

As a self-taught junior web developer with a focus on frontend technologies, I am eager to contribute my skills and passion to a dynamic team. Currently pursuing my degree at Addis Ababa Science and Technology University, Iâ€™ve gained practical experience, including developing a responsive website for a digital marketing company, Habits Marketing https://habitsmarketings.com

Engaged in ongoing local business projects, I embody a commitment to practical application and continuous improvement, crucial traits for an intern in a dynamic environment. My technical proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, combined with a problem-solving mindset and effective communication, positions me as a well-rounded candidate.

I am drawn to TalentKompass Deutschland for its commitment to developing interactive and responsive web solutions. Eager to contribute my dedication and skills to a team valuing innovation and excellence.

Open to internship opportunities. Excited about the prospect of contributing to TalentKompass Deutschland and gaining valuable industry experience.

Letâ€™s connect! ðŸš€

Sincerely,Akram Abdurahman Ahmed
